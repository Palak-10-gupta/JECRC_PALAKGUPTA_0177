# Question 2 – Dynamic Tax Computation Engine

## Step-1: Scenario Overview

You are building a Dynamic Tax Computation Engine for a finance application.

Different tax categories calculate tax differently:

- Individual Tax → Based on income slabs  
- Business Tax → Based on income + surcharge  
- Senior Citizen Tax → Special exemption rules  

### Key Constraints

- Tax rules change every financial year  
- Core tax engine must remain unchanged  
- Tax computation must return calculated value  

This scenario uses Func delegate for computation.

---

## Step-2: Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Entity Class

TaxPayer

### Properties:

- int TaxPayerId  
- string Name  
- double Income  
- double Surcharge  

---

### 2.2 Func Definition

Func<TaxPayer, double>

### Purpose:

- Represents a tax computation rule  
- Accepts TaxPayer data  
- Returns calculated tax amount  

---

### 2.3 Tax Rule Definitions

IndividualTaxRule  

Rule:  
Tax = Income × 10%

BusinessTaxRule  

Rule:  
Tax = (Income × 15%) + Surcharge  

SeniorCitizenTaxRule  

Rule:  
Tax = Income × 5%

---

## Step-3: Tax Engine (Core Component)

### TaxEngine Responsibilities

- Accept TaxPayer data  
- Accept Func delegate  
- Invoke function  
- Display tax amount  

### Important Design Rule

TaxEngine must NOT contain tax rules.

### Core Method

Compute(TaxPayer taxPayer, string category, Func<TaxPayer, double> calculator)

---

## Step-4: Main() Method – Runtime Configuration

### Step-by-Step Operations in Main()

1. Create tax payer object  
2. Define tax computation functions  
3. Create tax engine  
4. Compute individual tax  
5. Compute business tax  
6. Compute senior citizen tax

## Step-5: Hardcoded Dataset

TaxPayerId : 801  
Name       : Ravi  
Income     : 800000  
Surcharge  : 20000  

---

## Step-6: Expected Output

========= TAX COMPUTATION =========  
Name     : Ravi  
Category : Individual  
Tax      : 80000  
---------------------------------  

========= TAX COMPUTATION =========  
Name     : Ravi  
Category : Business  
Tax      : 140000  
---------------------------------  

========= TAX COMPUTATION =========  
Name     : Ravi  
Category : Senior Citizen  
Tax      : 40000  
---------------------------------  w
