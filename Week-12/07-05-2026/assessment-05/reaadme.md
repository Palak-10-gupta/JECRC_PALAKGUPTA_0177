Problem: Student Grade Processor

A school needs to process student grades across multiple subjects. Use arrays for grade storage and HashSet for unique student tracking.

## Requirements

- Store grades for multiple students
- Calculate average, highest, lowest for each student
- Find students with all grades above certain threshold
- Identify grade patterns (unique grades per student)

## Sample Input

```text
4

John 85 90 78 92

Sarah 95 88 91 89

Mike 70 65 80 75

Emma 88 92 94 96
```

---

## Operations to Perform

- Calculate each student's average
- Find top performer
- Find students with all grades >= 80
- Count unique grade values across all students

---

## Sample Output

```text
--- Student Grade Report ---

John: Average = 86.25, Highest = 92, Lowest = 78

Sarah: Average = 90.75, Highest = 95, Lowest = 88

Mike: Average = 72.50, Highest = 80, Lowest = 65

Emma: Average = 92.50, Highest = 96, Lowest = 88

Top Performer: Emma (Average: 92.50)

Students with all grades >= 80:

Sarah (95,88,91,89)

Emma (88,92,94,96)

Unique Grade Values Across All Students:

65,70,75,78,85,88,89,90,91,92,94,95,96

Total unique grades: 13
