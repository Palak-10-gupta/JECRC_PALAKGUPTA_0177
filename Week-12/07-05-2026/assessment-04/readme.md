# Sequence Pattern Detector

## Description

Problem: Sequence Pattern Detector

A security system needs to detect patterns in access logs.

## Requirements

- Find longest consecutive sequence of numbers
- Find most frequent element
- Find first non-repeating element
- Find pairs with difference K
- Find majority element (appears > n/2 times)

## Sample Input

```text
Access Log: 1,3,2,3,3,4,5,3,6,7,8,9,10,3

2
```

---

## Sample Output

```text
--- Access Pattern Analysis ---

Longest Consecutive Sequence: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (Length: 8)

Most Frequent Element: 3 (appears 5 times)

First Non-Repeating Element: 1

Pairs with Difference 2:

(1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (8, 10)

Majority Element: 3 (appears 5 out of 14 times - 35.7% - No majority)
