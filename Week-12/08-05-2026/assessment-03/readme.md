# Bank Account Hierarchy with Controlled State Management

## Description

Bank Account Hierarchy with Controlled State Management

Design an account hierarchy where different account types (`Savings` and `Current`) inherit from a base `BankAccount` class that enforces encapsulation through private setters.

## Functional Requirements

### Create a base class named BankAccount with:

#### Properties
- `accountNumber` → string (readonly, set via constructor)
- `balance` → double (private set)

#### Methods (virtual)
- `Deposit(double amount)` → returns boolean (validates amount > 0)
- `Withdraw(double amount)` → returns boolean (validates sufficient balance)
- `GetBalance()` → returns double

---

## SavingsAccount Class (derived from BankAccount)

### Additional Properties
- `interestRate` → double
- `minimumBalance` → double (default: 1000)

### Behavior
- `Withdraw()` should enforce minimum balance rule (balance cannot go below minimumBalance)
- `ApplyInterest()` → display:

```text
Interest Applied,Rate:<interestRate>,New Balance:<balance>
```

---

## CurrentAccount Class (derived from BankAccount)

### Additional Properties
- `overdraftLimit` → double
- `transactionFee` → double

### Behavior
- `Withdraw()` should allow overdraft up to overdraftLimit
- `DeductTransactionFee()` → display:

```text
Fee Deducted,Amount:<transactionFee>,Remaining:<balance>
```

---

## Input Format

- First line contains accountType (`Savings` or `Current`)
- Second line contains accountNumber
- Third line contains initial deposit
- Next lines contain operations

---

## Sample Input

```text
Savings
SAV123
5000
Withdraw 4500
GetBalance
ApplyInterest 5
```

---

## Sample Output

```text
Withdrawal Failed: Minimum balance requirement 1000

Current Balance: 5000

Interest Applied,Rate:5,New Balance:5250
```
